Predicting the Worldwide Gross Revenue for Hollywood Movies using Data Science

# About
This is a project for SC1015 - Intro to Data Science and AI) which focuses on the analysis on the Worldwide Gross Revenue of HollyWood Movies predictor. For the entire walkthrough of the project, please view the notebook in this order:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visaulization
4. Model Building 

# Problem Definition
- How different numeric and categorical variables of making a movie affects the worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
- Which model would be the best to predict?

# Models Used
1. Regression
2. Random Tree

# Key Takeaways from our Primary EDA
1. Number of Outliers
- Production Cost has 10 outliers.
- Worldwide Gross has 17 outliers.
- Runtime has 5 outliers.

2. Skewness of Data
- Production Cost has sknewness of 0.706946
- Worldwide Gross has sknewness of 0.873779
- Runtime has sknewness of 0.3821170
  
3. Correlation of Data
- Between the 2 variables (production cost & runtime), production cost has a higher correlation value of 0.49
  
4. Two Categorical datas were used for our analysis
- Genre
- MPAA Rating (in terms of appropriateness of movie)
